Oakland Shootings 2011 Data App
===============================

This project was published on <a href="http://oaklandnorth.net/2012/12/17/analyzing-gun-violence-in-oakland/">Oakland North</a> in December 2012. I used the Google Fusion API to build out a multilayered heat map showing shootings and victims by Oakland police beat. Also, when you click on a police beat, the two graphs under the map dynamic change to reflect the data of the geographic area picked.
